# Warehouse Forecaster - Streamlit Web Application

## What is this application?
This is a beginner-friendly web application that helps businesses predict their future 
warehouse inventory or sales data. It uses a machine learning model called 'Toto' to 
analyze historical data patterns and generate forecasts.

## How does it work?
1. Users upload their historical data as a CSV file
2. The app validates the data format
3. Users select how many days into the future they want to forecast
4. The app processes the data and generates predictions
5. Results are displayed as both tables and interactive charts

## Key Features:
- **Easy Data Upload**: Upload CSV files with your historical data
- **Flexible Forecasting**: Choose any forecast period from 1 to 90 days
- **Visual Results**: See your data and forecasts in interactive charts
- **Example Data**: Try the app with pre-loaded example data
- **Downloadable Results**: Save your forecast as a CSV file
- **Secure Access**: Domain-restricted for security

## Technical Details:
The application uses Streamlit for the web interface and connects to our custom
warehouse_forecast module which implements the Datadog Toto forecasting model.

    Check if the uploaded CSV file has the correct format for our forecasting model.
    
    What this function does:
    1. Tries to read the uploaded file as a UTF-8 text file
    2. Checks if it's a valid CSV with semicolons (;) as separators
    3. Verifies it has the required columns: DATE and VALUE
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    file : UploadedFile
        The file uploaded by the user through Streamlit's file_uploader
    
    Returns:
    --------
    tuple with three elements:
        - is_valid (bool): True if the file is correctly formatted
        - error_message (str): Empty if valid, otherwise explains what's wrong
        - csv_content (str): The file content as text if valid, None otherwise
    
    Example:
    --------

# --- Main App ---

def main():
    """
    The main function that creates our Streamlit web application.
    
    How a Streamlit app works:
    -------------------------
    - Streamlit runs this function from top to bottom
    - Each Streamlit command (st.something) adds an element to the web page
    - When a user interacts with an element, the entire script runs again
    
    What this function does step by step:
    -----------------------------------
    1. Sets up the page (title, icon, layout)
    2. Checks if the user is accessing from an allowed domain
    3. Creates the sidebar with input controls
    4. Creates the main panel with instructions and results
    5. Handles file uploads and validation
    6. Processes data and generates forecasts
    7. Displays results as tables and charts
    8. Provides download options for results
    
    App Structure:
    -------------
    - SIDEBAR: Contains inputs (forecast length, file upload, buttons)
    - MAIN PANEL: Contains instructions and forecast results
    
    Data Flow:
    ---------
    Upload/Example Data â†’ Validate â†’ Process â†’ Display Results
    
    State Management:
    ---------------
    We use st.session_state to remember data between user interactions
